And I decided to share a brief history and lessons I’ve learned in those 8 years leading my first startup.</p>\n<h2>How it all began</h2>\n<p>It was 2011, I was working as software developer and had just founded 1 year ago the web agency <a href=\"http://www.verticis.com.br\">Verticis Web Studio</a> along with my friends <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrebrunelli/\">André Brunelli</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaozica/\">João Zica</a>. I also met <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunoefa/\">Bruno Eustáquio</a>, aspiring entrepreneur full of ideas, and also the experienced and inspiring <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-vinicius-costa/\">Paulo Costa</a>. Brazil was living the heydays of the collective buying websites, and in one of our conversations on how to conquer the world we had the idea of ​​creating a platform to sell online tickets for entertainment events. At that time there was no self-service option that could serve the small and medium producers sector and we saw a great opportunity there and decided to dive into this endeavor.</p>\n<p>In early 2011, after some brainstorming sessions and some work, we already had our brand and some platform prototypes: <strong>RockBee</strong> was born!</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/f16bd/20190116-rockbee.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 740px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 54.86033519553073%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"20190116 rockbee\"\n        title=\"Rockbee logo\"\n        src=\"/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/87ff5/20190116-rockbee.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/6d00f/20190116-rockbee.png 185w,\n/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/24b81/20190116-rockbee.png 370w,\n/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/87ff5/20190116-rockbee.png 740w,\n/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/316f3/20190116-rockbee.png 1110w,\n/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/fb1ab/20190116-rockbee.png 1480w,\n/static/fc165d342f86be0bdea4b80729d98d6f/f16bd/20190116-rockbee.png 1790w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a><figcaption>First RockBee logo, created in 2011</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The first version of the platform was launched in July 2011, and we quickly gained traction in the event market in Brazil.</p>\n<h2>Pivot, Wayra and meuingresso.com</h2>\n<p>Right from the first year of operation, we detected an issue in our business model, and a great need of the market as well: there wasn’t at that time a self-service platform for selling tickets (EventBrite and other players were not yet active in the local market). And, in 2011, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/la/2011/11/25/accelerator-wayra-announces-brazilian-selected-startups/\">we were selected among 500 startups in Brazil to be accelerated by Wayra Brasil</a>, Telefonica’s startup accelerator.</p>\n<p>We received an initial investment, and developed the new version of the platform, which was launched in 2013, while we were inside the Wayra Academy. After 5 years of operation, we had a stable product and we were still looking for a way to grow even more.</p>\n<p>In early 2016 we conducted a survey with our producer base and found that perhaps our brand, an English name that did not directly link the product to our audience, could be a possible evolution point. We then decided to start an arduous process of rebranding and brand repositioning. We did several market studies, brainstorms and after a few months of work and negotiations, we launched <strong>meuingresso.com</strong>:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/9460d/20190116-branding.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 740px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.14973262032086%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"20190116 branding\"\n        title=\"Branding meuingresso.com\"\n        src=\"/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/87ff5/20190116-branding.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/6d00f/20190116-branding.png 185w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/24b81/20190116-branding.png 370w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/87ff5/20190116-branding.png 740w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/316f3/20190116-branding.png 1110w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/fb1ab/20190116-branding.png 1480w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/47430/20190116-branding.png 2220w,\n/static/91303b55c4fe517d434089b911a0f58a/9460d/20190116-branding.png 2618w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a><figcaption>Branding do meuingresso.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>We have had considerable growth, we have operated events for 15,000 people. By 2017 we had already moved R $ 4 million and we already had a base of more than 100,000 users.</p>\n<h2>Growth, expectations and future</h2>\n<p>Despite presenting a sustainable and healthy growth, some points began to make us consider a possible sale of the platform. Profitability was now directly related to investment in marketing and operation, and problems with logistics grew (outsourcing equipment, hiring support staff). As CEO and chief technical officer, I no longer felt that I would be able to make the necessary effort to grow.</p>\n<p>In addition, after 7 years at the helm of the project, there was the feeling of neglecting my career as an engineer and software manager after having spent the past 5 years focusing on bringing the best technical solution. Deep down, there was a big feeling that we were not getting 100% of the project’s potential.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I received an invitation to lead a team of Front-End developers in Berlin, where the focus of the major technology companies and startups was headed. I thought this was the right time and opportunity, and I decided to take up the challenge. During this period, myingresso.com kept operating normally and I continued to make technical decisions and support in a reduced amount of time.</p>\n<p>As early as 2018, the strength of the my-resales.com brand was growing, and the demand for closer care increased. On the other hand, career opportunities and personal growth in Germany only became more evident. That was when, in November 2018, we received the proposal of acquisition by the EventMix group, responsible for most of the major events in the south of the country, and present in several other regions of Brazil.</p>\n<p>After considering several factors we decided that the sale would be the best decision for the project, which was already close to 8 years of age. At the end of October, we began the transition, which was completed in early January 2019. The EventMix group decided to keep the mymresso.com brand, the visual identity and the unaltered operation at first. The group still promises to include several improvements in tools and process in the coming months.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<h4>1) Execution and timing are keys. An idea has its value close to zero</h4>\n<p>When we had the idea of ​​launching the self-service tool, Brazil was an unexplored market, and no platform had yet been launched. For some organizational issues at the beginning of our acceleration process and also due to our inexperience, it takes longer than expected to launch our first release. At that time, other platforms appeared on the market, and this had a major impact on our market acquisition strategy.</p>\n<h4>2) “Trust will not save you from infidelity”</h4>\n<p>At the beginning of our journey, we actively participated in events and made many contacts and partnerships. This has brought us excellent opportunities but also some problems. We had a mentor at the beginning of the project who helped us a lot, had access to all our planning, business plan, spreadsheets. He later declined our equity offer as an advisor and appeared with the lead investor of a competing startup. Nothing that shook or discouraged us, but it was a great learning.</p>\n<p>In another context, we also met a famous Brazilian investor, founder of one of the largest national e-commerces. He became close contact, and always made promises of future investments and partnerships, but nothing concrete. Over time he became a personal friend, even calling on his birthday and on special occasions. At one point, he made me the proposal that every entrepreneur would like to hear: I would act as a CTO for one of his projects, develop his platform, and receive $ 3,000.00 monthly, and could still continue to meet the demands of myingresso.com (in the RockBee era). I accepted the proposal, and we started the project.</p>\n<p>It was a difficult time for a double trip. In 9 months, the platform was ready and in production. However, the payments were never made as promised. After the completion of the project, the friendship of the beginning was disappearing, and the excuses for not performing the payment went varying. Until at one point all my contacts were no longer answered, I was blocked in all their social networks and disappeared, leaving a debt of $ 14,000.00.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is very clear: asking for help, having mentors, partnering and attending events is very important. But always be suspicious. Always ask for NDA’s signature before sharing any information about your business. Document everything, make small contracts, even informal ones.</p>\n<h4>3) Personal life while undertaking</h4>\n<p>The entrepreneurial dream is one of the most fascinating things I’ve ever experienced in my life. That feeling of being very close to something grand, that at any moment an unexpected turn will happen. And it is this feeling that makes us believe that every effort is worth it, including sacrificing some aspects of his personal life, believing it to be a “temporary effort” and highly rewarded. Today I see that even if this time is even short and properly rewarded, this sacrifice is not worth it. Sleeping good nights of sleep, having well-deserved leisure time and being close to family and friends is something that will certainly impact directly on the success of your journey!</p>\n<h2>Future</h2>\n<p>Today I work as Engineering Lead and CTO in one of Europe’s most prominent software development markets, directly involved in the development of startups and new businesses. And so begins 2019, ending a full cycle of growth and learning. And a story of great gratitude!</p>\n<p>Long live the <strong>“Rock Bee”</strong>!</p>\n<p>🎉 🎸 🚀 🐝 ️️❤️</p>","excerpt":"The year of 2018 had many achievements and experiences and could not end better: after a long negotiation and transition period, we sold…","timeToRead":6,"fields":{"tagSlugs":[{"tag":"personal","link":"/tags/personal/"},{"tag":"entrepreneurship","link":"/tags/entrepreneurship/"}],"slug":"/blog/my-first-exit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My first exit: what I've learned in 8 years leading meuingresso.com","tags":["personal","entrepreneurship"],"date":"2019-01-16","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/f2b68/20190116.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/0f1b0/20190116.jpg 188w,\n/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/b8241/20190116.jpg 375w,\n/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/f2b68/20190116.jpg 750w,\n/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/ff0a9/20190116.jpg 1125w,\n/static/2923728d07b82b4c7408f8fbd6cd46fd/bbc98/20190116.jpg 1500w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}},"structuredData":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://www.hugomagalhaes.com","disqusShortname":"hugomagalhes","author":{"name":"Hugo Nogueira","email":"hugomn@gmail.com","twitter":"hugomn"}}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en"}}
